<p>Why are you here?? This site is still under construction! Well, since you're here, feel free to read anyway.
    But do keep in mind that this is still a work-in-progress!

<h1>Hi, I'm neropatti</h1>
<p>Decided to set up a page for myself! Keeping it simple for now.</p>
<p>I'm just an average Finnish dude who likes programming & playing video games.</p>
<p>I do have some <a href=https://neropatti.itch.io>released games</a>, but below you can find more examples of my work.</p>

<h2>Seamless</h2>
<p>Seamless is a minimalistic 2D puzzle-platformer where different coloured boxes form the enviroment.</p>

<p>I wrote a custom collision system to handle these collisions.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of colliders: Holes & Boxes. Holes define the inbounds space. The player has to be enclosed by the inbounds
    space every tick; if they aren't, they are pushed back inside. This sounds relatively simple, until you consider that you don't 
    necessarily have to be enclosed by any <em>single</em> hole to be inbounds.
</p>

<p>The collision detection is discrete, but the physics ticks are split into multiple sub-ticks if the relative speed between
    the player and the enviroment is too large. This collision system will handle basically anything you can think of
    to throw at it; and come out looking good.

<p>However, there is one big limitation. For example, every collider in Seamless is an axis-alinged rectangle.</p>
