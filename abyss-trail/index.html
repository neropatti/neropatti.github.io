<p>Abyss trail was my submission to the 7th Brackeys game jam. It placed #234 out of 1606 total entries overall.</p>

<p>I had entered one jam before, but didn't manage to finish in time.
    With Abyss Trail, I really focused on keeping the scope under control.
    The game turned out quite simple, but I was happy with it.
