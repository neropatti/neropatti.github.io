<h2>Build Sprint</h2>
<p>NOTE: This version of the project has been abandoned. I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://neropatti.com/voxel-parkour-game">the current version</a> :)</p>
<p>One day, I decided that I wanted to make a 3D movement-based first-person platform fighter with rollback netcode, with the maps made out of voxels. I had no experience making multiplayer games, voxel engines, or even platform fighters. Regardless, I started work on Build Sprint, a voxel engine made with Godot.</p>
<p>I under-estimated the amount of work &amp; learning required.</p>
<p> So, now instead of making the thing I really want to make, I'm making something a bit more simple: a 3D first-person platformer! Coincidentally, the name &quot;Build Sprint&quot; lends itself nicely as a code-name for a parkour game.</p>

<p>The movement mechanics are good enough for now, and I'm more focused on exploring what direction to take the level design in. I'm not comfortable/good at level design yet (the best I've managed is in the video above), so it might be a long journey.</p>
