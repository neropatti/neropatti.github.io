<h1>Voxel raytracing</h1>
<p>My current project! Well, at least at the time of writing this.</p>
<p>This project is a successor of <a href="https://neropatti.com/build-sprint">Build Sprint</a>.</p>
<p>I grew frustrated with the code I was working with and the things I was doing, so I decided to try making the game without an engine.</p>

<p>Right now I'm still working on the rendering. I raytrace the voxels with the help of an octree.</p>
<!-- TODO: Link the resources that I learned from!! -->
<p>During the process of making the raytracer, I've broken it a few times. Here are some pretty screenshots:</p>
